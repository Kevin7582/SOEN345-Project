## Project Overview
This project is a **Cloud-based Ticket Reservation Application** designed to assist users in registering for their desired events. 

The system provides clear access to events organized in different locations and categories throughout the year. Organizers will have a place to advertise, arrange, and secure tickets for their events while users will have a place that centralizes all sorts of different events to be browsed and registered for.

## Core Features

### Event Registration
- Users will be able to easily register for events they would like to attend.
- Users will be able to easily sort, search, and filter through all the events available to find those most suited to them.

### Event Hosting
- Organizers will be able to create events on the site so that they reach our user base and advertise their events to them.
